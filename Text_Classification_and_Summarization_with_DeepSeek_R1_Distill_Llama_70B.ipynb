Prospective investors will be drawn to how quickly Snap has grown its advertising business in roughly two years, with the company showing a nearly sevenfold increase between 2015 and last year. The question is how long the   can maintain anywhere close to that kind of growth. The company said in its prospectus that it views daily active users as a critical measure of engagement  \\u2014   a measure that is tracked closely by similar companies. (Facebook on Wednesday reported that it had an average of 1. 23 billion daily active users in December.) As does every company in this kind of filing, Snap laid out a number of potential risks to its business. Among them is Britain\\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, what has come to be known as Brexit, which could pose large problems for the company because it recently designated London as its international hub. Snap noted that other countries may choose to censor Snapchat. Moreover, the company pointed out that many of Google\\u2019s services, which power a significant portion of Snap\\u2019s computer services, are restricted in China. So, according to Snap, it isn\\u2019t clear \\u201cif we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government. \\u201d The company was originally built for users to send   photographs and messages to their friends. But the company\\u2019s ambitions have grown to include user stories, news and branded content. Evan Spiegel, 26, one of Snap\\u2019s two founders, started the company while he was a student at Stanford. Mr. Spiegel, who is the company\\u2019s chief executive and serves on the board, owns a stake in the company that was worth $3. 7 billion at the end of last year. His 2016 compensation package came to $2. 6 million and included $503, 205 in base salary, a $1 million bonus and $901, 635 in other compensation that covered his $890, 339 personal security budget. The company\\u2019s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, received nearly $151 million during that same time, largely because of a $145 million stock award when he joined the company from the investment bank Credit Suisse in 2015. A month before the company first filed initial public offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its two   each sold stock worth $8. 1 million. The company more than tripled its employee ranks from 2015 to 2016. Yet even with 1, 859 staffers, the company has a relatively small number of workers relative to its valuation. Snap noted that it hired a law firm that employs Mr. Spiegel\\u2019s father. The elder Mr. Spiegel is a litigator who represented Transocean, which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig at the center of the BP oil disaster. The company has attracted a number of prominent backers, who are expected to reap handsome rewards  \\u2014   if only on paper  \\u2014   in the initial public offering. Among them are investment firms like Benchmark Capital, which owns about 13 percent of the company. Snap\\u2019s offering is being led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley won the desired \\u201clead left\\u201d position on the prospectus, which indicates that it is the bank that will play the biggest role in the offering. The bank also led Facebook\\u2019s initial public offering.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON  \\u2014   Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called \\u201cthis American carnage. \\u201d In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by \\u201cthe ravages\\u201d of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his   approach to turn around. \\u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,\\u201d Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of   admirers and onlookers in a forceful   Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. \\u201cAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. \\u201d Mr. Trump\\u2019s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system. \\u201cWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. \\u201d Mr. Trump\\u2019s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address  \\u2014   a country where mothers and children are \\u201ctrapped in poverty in our inner cities,\\u201d where \\u201c  factories\\u201d are \\u201cscattered like tombstones across the landscape\\u201d and where drugs and crime \\u201chave stolen too many lives. \\u201d \\u201cThis American carnage,\\u201d he declared, \\u201cstops right here and stops right now. \\u201d He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to \\u201cease the burden\\u201d of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week. Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a   suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the   oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president. The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations  \\u2014   James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security  \\u2014   but Democrats temporarily held up Mike Pompeo\\u2019s confirmation as C. I. A. director. Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president. Sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine, while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas. More than 200 people were arrested. Liberal groups prepared for a women\\u2019s march on Saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands. Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition. \\u201cThey have been magnificent,\\u201d he said in his speech. He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a    luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause. \\u201cI have a lot of respect for these two people,\\u201d he said. Democrats were not impressed. \\u201cI was pretty shocked by how dark it was,\\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said of Mr. Trump\\u2019s Inaugural Address. \\u201cI love this country, and I don\\u2019t understand how a president of the United States that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures. \\u201d He added, \\u201cIt was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was. \\u201d The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d hats and chanting \\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\\u201d But the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display, too. When Mrs. Clinton arrived, some in the crowd chanted, \\u201cLock her up,\\u201d mimicking Mr. Trump\\u2019s campaign rallies. As he took the oath, a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed, \\u201cNot my president,\\u201d before being escorted out. While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obama\\u2019s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs. The Washington Metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on Friday morning as in 2009, and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick. In a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to Mr. Trump, many residents left town and about 60 House Democrats boycotted the event. Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif. for vacation. He will return to Washington to a rental house while his daughter Sasha finishes high school, the first president to stay in the capital since Woodrow Wilson. Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away. \\u201cI won\\u2019t stop,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love. \\u201d Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there. But they, too, planned to return, at least part time, to Washington, where Mrs. Biden teaches at a community college in the Virginia suburbs. The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids. Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military. At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with   business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country\\u2019s begin. He arrived in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf. But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency. An Ivy   mogul who lives in a New York tower named after himself with an    living room, he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a   movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts. His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing   to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites. For the nation\\u2019s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition. He and Mrs. Trump, a former model from Slovenia who became the first   first lady since John Quincy Adams\\u2019s wife, Louisa, started the day with a service at St. John\\u2019s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, then joined the Obamas, Bidens and Pences for coffee at the White House. From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump\\u2019s election. Former President George Bush remained hospitalized in Houston, recovering from pneumonia, but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television. Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a. m. placing his hand on Ronald Reagan\\u2019s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched. For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013. Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr. Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany. Also there was Barron, his    son with the first lady. Joining them was Ivanka\\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser. As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall. It was not a conventionally Republican speech, with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government. Instead, he laid out a protectionist agenda, saying his rule will be \\u201cbuy American and hire American. \\u201d He did pledge to \\u201ceradicate from the face of the Earth\\u201d Islamic terrorism. Responding to charges that he demonized Mexicans and Muslims, Mr. Trump said, \\u201cThere is no room for prejudice. \\u201d Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another. \\u201cWe are transferring power from Washington, D. C. and giving it back to you, the people,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFor too long,\\u201d he continued, \\u201ca small group in our nation\\u2019s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth. \\u201d He added, \\u201cThat all changes starting right here and right now. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
